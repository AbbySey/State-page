<p>
Boulder is somewhere I have always wanted to visit. I have been there as a child but it wasn't a memorable experice. They have cool things downtown and are right up there at the base of the mountians.

<p>
I would love to go here. There is so much to do from the train ride through the gorge, to the swing over the gorge. Most of the attrations are for thrill seekers and will have your blood pumping. But, you don't have to do those you can go just for the amazing views! One of the most popular attrations there would be the swing over the gorge. I would love to go just for that and yes, You are strapped in and they do take proper saftey percations.

<h3>Telluride</h3>

<p>
I have heard alot about Telluride, Colorado but I have never actually made the effort to visit. Telliride is full of history for history lovers, It is a old victorian mining town and is a popular ski and golf resort. It is located way up into the rocky mountians. I was born in Colorado. I was born in Longmont which is at the other end of the state so it is quite a drive when I go to vist my hometown.
